## :pray: Credits

This library contains 59 predefined color schemes inside the `themes` module. Those are all directly copied from [FlexColorScheme](https://rydmike.com/flexcolorscheme/themesplayground-latest/) - a very useful homepage that allows you to **create your own themes** and also contains 54 predefined themes already. With the permission of [Rydmike](https://github.com/rydmike) I just copied every single predefined theme from his homepage and added it to this library.
