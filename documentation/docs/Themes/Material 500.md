I took all 19 500 colors from the [Material 500 color palette](https://materialui.co/colors) and created themes based on them.

With the help of [this homepage](https://colors.muz.li/) I generated matching colors of following types:

* analogic
* mono
* tetrade
* triade

Then I took the first 3 colors and put them into the [material theme builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/) and use the "color match" preference.

The results are 19 theme colors each in 4 different variants leading to 76 themes in total.
